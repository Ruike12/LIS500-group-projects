        <h2>About Ifeoma Ozoma</h2>
        <p>
            <span class="highlight">Ifeoma Ozoma</span> is a leading advocate for fairness, inclusion, and ethical responsibility in the tech industry.
            One of the most famous examples was when she exposed unfair treatment within Pinterest while working at the company.
            In 2020, <span class="highlight">Ifeoma Ozoma</span> and her colleague Aerica Shimizu Banks accused the company of
            <span class="bold">wage inequality, racial discrimination, and workplace retaliation.</span>
            Her whistleblowing led Pinterest to pay <span class="bold">$22 million</span> to settle with female employees, sparking conversations about race and gender equality in tech.

<!-- Group Reflection -->
<div class="reflection">
    <h2>Our Group Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        While discussing <span class="highlight">Ifeoma Ozoma</span>, we realized that we all belong to a minority group in the United States.
        Her journey deeply resonated with us because the injustices she faced are similar to the struggles many minorities encounter in the workforce.
        <span class="bold">She transformed adversity into advocacy</span>, inspiring others to challenge systemic biases.
    </p >
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">Ifeoma Ozoma</span> is not just a woman, but a <span class="bold">Black woman</span>, meaning the discrimination she faced
        was not only <span class="bold">sexism</span> or <span class="bold">racism</span>, but the systemic bias at their intersection.

<!-- Discussion on Implicit Bias -->
<div class="bias-discussion">
    <h2>Let's Talk About Implicit Bias</h2>
    <p>
        <span class="highlight">Pinterest</span> did not publicly acknowledge gender and racial discrimination, but
        <span class="bold">Ifeoma Ozoma’s report</span> revealed implicit bias in pay, promotions, and working conditions.
    </p >
    <p>
        As <span class="bold">Asian students</span> entering the job market, we notice racial biases in hiring practices.
        Many companies promote diversity on paper, yet their hiring and promotion decisions often reflect implicit biases.
    </p >
    <p>
        In customer service and public-facing roles, Asian-American candidates are often perceived as lacking <span class="bold">"charisma"</span> 
        or <span class="bold">"social skills"</span>, reducing their opportunities in industries requiring interpersonal engagement.

<!-- Challenges for Asian Students in the Workforce -->
<div class="challenges">
    <h2>Challenges for Asian Students in the Workforce</h2>
    <p>Our discussion on <span class="highlight">Ifeoma Ozoma’s advocacy</span> made us realize that different minority groups face interrelated biases. 
        As <span class="bold">Asian students</span> entering the workforce, we are concerned about:</p >
    <ul>
        <li>Being labeled as <span class="bold">"hard-working but unfit to lead"</span>, limiting career growth.</li>
        <li>Having our cultural communication style misinterpreted as <span class="bold">"too conservative"</span> or <span class="bold">"not outspoken enough"</span>.</li>
        <li>Encountering a <span class="bold">racial glass ceiling</span>, similar to what <span class="highlight">Ifeoma</span> and other women of color have faced in corporate America.</li>
    </ul>
