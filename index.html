                <p>Welcome! This website is a part of <strong>Project #2 - Developing Projects Website</strong>, where we explore the themes of intersectionality, implicit bias, and technology’s role in shaping social experiences. Our project builds on materials from Project #1, expanding them into a multi-page interactive website.</p>

            <!-- Overview of Project #1 -->
            <section>
                <h2>Project #1 Overview</h2>
                <p>In our first project, we engaged in critical thinking and discussions about intersectionality and implicit bias through a structured learning process:</p>
                
                <h3>Step 1: Exploring Intersectionality & Bias</h3>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Take an Implicit Bias Test (IBT)</strong> – We explored Harvard’s IAT (Implicit Association Test) to reflect on unconscious biases.</li>
                    <li><strong>Alternative Approach</strong> – Instead of the test, we could engage with academic discussions, such as reading Robin DiAngelo’s work on racism discourse or Ben Shapiro’s critique of intersectionality.</li>
                </ul>
               <!--our projects step 2-->> 
                
                <h3>Step 2: Group Video Discussion</h3>
                <p>In teams of 2-3, we created a 15-minute video discussing:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>✔️ Our backgrounds, interests, and reasons for taking this class.</li>
                    <li>✔️ Our thoughts on bias tests or the readings by DiAngelo and Shapiro.</li>
                    <li>✔️ How we perceive intersectionality and its role in shaping digital experiences.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Bonus:</strong> We explored creative ways to enhance our video with visual elements, accessibility features, and editing effects.</p>
                
                <h3>Step 3 & 4: Community Engagement</h3>
                <p>After posting our video to the Discussion Room & Classroom Café, we engaged with our peers by watching and commenting on two other videos.</p>
