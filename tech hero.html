    <h2>About Ifeoma Ozoma</h2>
    <p>
        Ifeoma is a leading advocate for fairness, inclusion, and ethical responsibility in the tech industry. 
        One of the most famous examples was when she exposed unfair treatment within Pinterest while working at the company.
        In 2020, Ifeoma Ozoma, a former employee on Pinterest's public policy team, joined colleague Aerica Shimizu Banks 
        in publicly accusing the company of wage inequality, racial discrimination, and workplace retaliation. 
        Her whistleblowing ultimately prompted Pinterest to pay $22 million to settle with female employees and 
        prompted more discussion within the tech industry about race and gender equality.

        <p>
        We also want to introduce Jensen Huang, the CEO and co-founder of NVIDIA. 
        Huang integrates computer graphics, artificial intelligence, semiconductor engineering, and high-performance computing. 
        His drive to upgrade GPUs from gaming tools to accelerators for AI and deep learning has reshaped multiple industries.
    </p>
    <p>
        His status as a Taiwanese immigrant to the United States highlights the intersectionality of Silicon Valley leadership. 
        His success as one of the few Asian-American CEOs at a major U.S. tech company has broken down barriers 
        for racial minorities in executive positions.

        NVIDIA's Earth-2 simulation platform shows how AI can be used to take climate action and solve environmental justice problems.

    <h2>Our Group Reflection</h2>
    <p>
        While our group was discussing Ifeoma, we discovered that we were all part of a minority in the United States. 
        We greatly admire her because her experience and upbringing are inspiring to us. Her story resonated with us. 
        Because the inequities she encountered are similar to the challenges many minority groups face in the professional world. 
        She transformed personal adversity into a movement for change, inspiring others to stand up against injustice.
    </p>
    <p>
        Ifeoma is not only a woman, but also a Black woman, and the injustice she experienced was not just sexism or racism, 
        but systemic bias at the intersection of the two.
    </p>

<!-- Section: Discussion on Implicit Bias -->
<section>
    <h2>Let's Talk About Implicit Bias</h2>
    <p>
        Pinterest does not openly acknowledge gender and racial discrimination. 
        But Ifeoma's report suggests implicit bias in pay, promotions, and working conditions, 
        with Black women's voices being ignored.
    </p>
    <p>
        In our group discussion, we as Asian students. When we are faced with job hunting, many tech companies 
        or service industry companies may be racially biased against Asian students. Many companies claim to value 
        diversity and inclusion, but their hiring and promotion practices often show an implicit bias against minorities. 
        In customer service and public-facing roles, companies may view Asian-American candidates as lacking "charisma" 
        or "social skills," limiting their opportunities in industries that focus on interpersonal skills.

    <h2>Challenges for Asian Students in the Workforce</h2>
    <p>
        Our discussion of Ifeoma Ozoma's advocacy has made us aware that all minority groups face different but 
        interrelated implicit biases. As Asian students preparing to enter the workforce, we are concerned about:
    </p>
    <ul>
        <li>Being labeled "hard-working but unfit to lead," which limits our professional growth.</li>
        <li>Our cultural communication style is misinterpreted as being "too conservative" or "not outspoken enough," 
            thereby reducing our chances of standing out in a competitive job market.</li>
        <li>Facing a racial glass ceiling similar to what Ifeoma and other women of color have experienced in corporate America.</li>
    </ul>
