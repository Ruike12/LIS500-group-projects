            <h3>Our IBT Experiences</h3>
            <p> Regarding the Harvard Implicit Association Test (IAT), we’ve taken the adult version, with the first section focusing on race. During the test, Ruike had to read and understand sentences quickly and respond accordingly. This experience made Ruike realize how unconscious biases can exist within us without our awareness. Tests like this have made me realize that many times, we may not know much about our inner thoughts or biases. Yunning found the experience really interesting. While Yunning won’t share her specific results, Yunning think the test made her reflect on how unconscious biases can influence the way we think, make decisions, and interact with others.

        <section>
            <h2>Understanding Intersectionality</h2>
            <p>Intersectionality describes how overlapping social identities, like race, gender, and class, impact experiences of oppression or privilege.</p>
            <p><strong>Watch this short video:</strong> Kimberlé Crenshaw, who coined the term "Intersectionality," explains its importance in social justice.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>Implicit Bias in Hiring and the Workplace</h2>
            <p>Many companies claim to support diversity, but implicit biases in hiring, promotion, and workplace culture create invisible barriers for marginalized groups.
                As international students, we may feel this implicit bias more than local job seekers. While many companies profess to support diversity when hiring, unconscious bias can still influence employers' decisions, for example in screening resumes, interview communications, and career development opportunities. Factors such as language ability, cultural background and visa restrictions can also be hidden barriers to hiring and promotion. In addition, workplace culture may default to the habits of mainstream groups, making international students feel challenged in socializing, teamwork, and career development. Therefore, we as international students need to not only demonstrate our professional competence when applying for jobs, but also learn to identify and deal with potential implicit biases.</p>

        <section>
            <h2>The Role of AI in Bias</h2>
            <p>Artificial Intelligence is often seen as neutral, but AI systems inherit human biases because they are trained on existing data.
                These biases can manifest in various ways, such as skewed hiring algorithms, facial recognition inaccuracies, and disparities in healthcare diagnostics.
                For example, AI-driven hiring tools have been found to favor certain demographics over others, reinforcing systemic inequalities.
                Similarly, facial recognition technology has been shown to misidentify individuals with darker skin tones at higher rates, leading to concerns about discrimination in law enforcement and security applications.</p>
